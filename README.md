# Taskschd - Bypassing

No use in hiding Schedueled tasks like Taskmgr.

Almost every server bans the use of Schedueling CMD, and if you'd like to get away with schedueling CMD you have to find a way to bypass scanners and ss'ers. The easier way is schedueling Taskmgr and opening CMD/Conhost from their.

Changning schedueled tasks name in which the task is taskmgr (Launchatm: bruzens taskschd - taskmgr task name. Or VscHostCode: Jake's taskschd - taskmgr task name.) Doesnt matter, the name doesnt matter as its not bannable.

IMPORTANT/TLDR: In conclusion, please stop dming me asking if the taskschd name is leaked as it doesnt matter; even if they find the schedueled taskmgr task they cant ban off of it.
